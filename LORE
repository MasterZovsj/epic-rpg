You have woken up in a cold,dark room with cynder block walls covered in years and years of mildew and vacancy.
The only light is emitted by one distant amber light bulb covered by a broken glass globe filled with the corps of moths and fly's.
The paint on the walls have began to peel from years of neglect. The the sound of old creeky hardwood flooring slats can be heard
from just above. The room is windowless, the only exit is a windowless steel door.
The scene is unfamiliar as yester day you were working as a [insertoccupation] with a family. you have arrived in this room through
a black hole. The room has a variety of building materieral that could be of use to defend yourself 2x4 boards,old corroded 
galvanized pipe, red clay bricks, and a splintered wood handled shovel. Please choose your weapon [insert weapon].
You are all alone in this dark room clueless of what awaits on the other side of the windowless steel door. You have no friends,
no family, and nobody to call for help. The only way out of this nightmare is through the door [please open the door]
