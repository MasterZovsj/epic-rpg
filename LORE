You have woken up in a cold,dark room with cynder block walls covered in years and years of mildew and vacancy.
The only light is emitted by one distant amber light bulb covered by a broken glass globe filled with the corps of moths and fly's.
The paint on the walls have began to peel from years of neglect. The the sound of old creeky hardwood flooring slats can be heard
from just above. THe room is windowless, the only exit is a windowless steel door.
The scene is unfamiliar
